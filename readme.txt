Keep your content fresh and up to date! Content Freshness plugin shows a list of posts that have not been updated for a set period of time.

== Description ==

Updating your articles is important to keep them fresh and to help maintain their rankings in Google and other search engines. But if you have a large site with hundreds of posts, it may be hard to keep track of all your articles and when they were last updated.

With Content Freshness, you can easily see which articles are in need of an update. You will see the dates when they were last modified, so that you can update them accordingly. You can select the timeframe for content updating - whether 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year (the default is 6 months).

If your website is already added to Google Search Console, you can choose to activate the GSC Performance option. Use it to check your individual post's search results performance in Google Search Console before you update your articles.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
